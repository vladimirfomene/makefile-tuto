#Makefile Version 1
#The names before the colons in Makefiles are called targets
#They specify the name of a set of rules that you want to run to achieve a particular goal.
#To follow along make sure you install the GNU make utility via the terminal (`sudo apt install make` on ubuntu)
#It is recommended for every make file to have an all and a clean target.

#the all target depends on the hello target
all: hello

#the rules of the hello target represent the commands you will have typed on the terminal to create the program `hello`
hello: hello.c greeting.c
	gcc -o hello hello.c greeting.c -I.

clean:
	rm -f *.o Makefile hello
	mv Makefile.orig Makefile
