#Makefile version 2
#we can add variables to make files
#CC and CFLAGS are makefile variables. 
#They are referenced using $() and are always declared at the top of the file.
#CC is a variable that specifies which compiler to use to compile your program.
#If given the name of a particular compiler, that compiler will be used to compile programs
#Otherwise it will use the default compiler for C
#RM is a variable which is equivalent to `rm -f`.


CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I.

all: hello

hello: hello.o greeting.o
	$(CC) -o hello hello.o greeting.o $(CFLAGS)

clean:
	$(RM) *.o Makefile hello
	mv Makefile.orig Makefile
